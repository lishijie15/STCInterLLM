## Abstract

<p style="text-align: justify">
Spatio-temporal forecasting plays a crucial role in the dynamic perception of smart cities, such as traffic flow prediction, renewable energy forecasting, and load prediction. It aims to understand the trends of spatio-temporal changes under the interaction of various factors. Sufficient high-quality data and powerful models form the foundation for accurate spatio-temporal forecasting. Unfortunately, in reality, data is often sparse. In such cases, while adaptive graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs) can maintain performance, they face issues of spatial spurious associations and hallucinations, respectively. These issues further affect the ability of the model to learn and infer cross spatio-temporal and cross-scale features. To address this, we propose a novel model named Spatio-Temporal Causal Intervention Large Language Model (STCInterLLM). This model employs a newly designed causal intervention encoder to update spatial spurious correlations in the spatio-temporal adaptive graph. Subsequently, the novel Chain-of-Action instruction text is utilized to enforce the decomposition of the prediction process, thereby enhancing the causal representation of features while mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. Finally, a lightweight marker alignment module ensures the consistency of the encoder, instruction text, and LLM, enabling accurate forecasting of distinct scale spatio-temporal evolution patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on power distribution systems integrated with renewable energy sources and transportation systems encompassing diverse types of data, demonstrating that the proposed STCInterLLM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across significantly different scenarios.

## Introduction of Our Model

* To better adapt to various scenarios lacking high-quality data, we propose the STInterLLM, which integrates a novel encoder and instruction-tuning to achieve efficient and accurate large-scale spatio-temporal prediction while minimizing double hallucinations.
* To precisely eliminate spurious spatio-temporal associations caused by adaptive graphs, we specifically design the lightweight causal inference and intervention mechanism named causal intervention encoder. This is integrated with multi-scale temporal feature extraction modules to help the encoder enable the LLM to understand and learn complex spatio-temporal evolution patterns.
* To effectively mitigate hallucinations in the LLM, we construct a novel Chains-of-Action instruction-tuning and alignment module. By enforcing step-by-step decomposition and examples of predictive actions, ensuring that the LLM aligns with and comprehends the complex information provided by the proposed encoder.
* To fully evaluate the performance of the model, we conduct extensive experiments based on the Power Distribution System (PDS) (Scenario 1) and NYC-taxi (Scenario 2) datasets. The proposed STInterLLM achieves SOTA performance across various spatio-temporal scenarios.

### 2. Training STCInterLLM

<span id='Prepare Pre-trained Checkpoint'/>

#### 2.1. Preparing Pre-trained Checkpoint

STCInterLLM is trained based on following excellent existing models.

It is worth noting that the provided examples are primarily designed for Scenario 1. To adapt to different scenarios, please use the corresponding files and modify scripts such as [Power_Llama.py](./STCILLM/model/Power_Llama.py) accordingly.

Please follow the instructions to prepare the checkpoints.

- `Vicuna`:
  Prepare our base model Vicuna, which is an instruction-tuned chatbot and base model in our implementation. Please download its weights [here](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#model-weights). We generally utilize v1.5 and v1.5-16k model with 7B parameters. You should update the 'config.json' of vicuna, for example, the 'config.json' in v1.5-16k can be found in [config.json](checkpoints/config.json)

- `Causal Intervention Encoder`:
  
  we specifically design the lightweight causal inference and intervention mechanism named causal intervention encoder. This is integrated with multi-scale temporal feature extraction modules to help the encoder enable the LLM to understand and learn complex spatio-temporal evolution patterns. The weights of [Causal Intervention Encoder](checkpoints/Causal_Encoder/Causal_Encoder.pth) are pre-trained through a typical multi-step spatio-temporal prediction task.
  
- `Spatio-temporal Train Data`:

  To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting spatio-temporal patterns across different scenarios, we have constructed two distinct scale scenarios. Scenario 1 involves net load forecasting for large-scale PDSs, considering the integration of substantial Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Scenario 2 focuses on traffic flow prediction, taking into account factors such as crime rates. These data are organized in [train_data](./STCInterLLM/ST_data_STCInterLLM/train_data). Please download them and put them at ./STCInterLLM/ST_data/train_10pv.
